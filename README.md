# FedACK
The code for paper "Cross Platforms Linguals and Models Social Bot Detection via Federated Adversarial Contrastive Knowledge Distillation." on Web Conference 2023 (WWW).

# Federated learning module
The code implementation of the federated learning module is stored in the FLAgorithms directory.
The model directory stored the backbone model design for social bot detection.
The implementation of server-side and client-side code for federated learning is stored in the servers/users directories.

# ~Federated learning module
The codes stored in infer,  loss, util, and model directories are used to train cross-lingual module.

The main.py is used for training FL module for social bots detection.
The train.py is used for pre-traing cross-lingual module.
